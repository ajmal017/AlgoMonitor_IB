##About

IB_Monitor is an automated monitoring program, meant to monitor active IB_INSYNC / IB API strategies, 
and aggregate data related to performance.
The end goal is a web app, that could be accessed ANYWHERE, 
as long as the failsafe program is running on the root machine.

Final product will likely be a Dash web application, enabling the program to be platform independent -- 
and allowing monitoring from ANY device.
